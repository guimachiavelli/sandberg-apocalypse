 is right. 21:9 It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house. 21:10 The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes. 21:11 When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge. 21:12 The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked: but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness. 21:13 Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard. 21:14 A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath. 21:15 It is joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity. 21:16 The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead. 21:17 He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich. 21:18 The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright. 21:19 It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry woman. 21:20 There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up. 21:21 He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour. 21:22 A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof. 21:23 Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles. 21:24 Proud and haughty scorner is his name, who dealeth in proud wrath. 21:25 The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour. 21:26 He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and spareth not. 21:27 The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination: how much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind? 21:28 A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly. 21:29 A wicked man hardeneth his face: but as for the upright, he directeth his way. 21:30 There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD. 21:31 The horse is prepared against the day of battle: but safety is of the LORD. 22:1 A GOOD name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and loving favour rather than silver and gold. 22:2 The rich and poor meet together: the LORD is the maker of them all. 22:3 A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simple pass on, and are punished. 22:4 By humility and the fear of the LORD are riches, and honour, and life. 22:5 Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward: he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them. 22:6 Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it. 22:7 The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender. 22:8 He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his anger shall fail. 22:9 He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth of his bread to the poor. 22:10 Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife and reproach shall cease. 22:11 He that loveth pureness of heart, for the grace of his lips the king shall be his friend. 22:12 The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, and he overthroweth the words of the transgressor. 22:13 The slothful man saith, There is a lion without, I shall be slain in the streets. 22:14 The mouth of strange women is a deep pit: he that is abhorred of the LORD shall fall therein. 22:15 Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him. 22:16 He that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches, and he that giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want. 22:17 Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine heart unto my knowledge. 22:18 For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they shall withal be fitted in thy lips. 22:19 That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to thee this day, even to thee. 22:20 Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge, 22:21 That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee? 22:22 Rob not the poor, because he is poor: neither oppress the afflicted in the gate: 22:23 For the LORD will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them. 22:24 Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt not go: 22:25 Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul. 22:26 Be not thou one of them that strike hands, or of them that are sureties for debts. 22:27 If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed from under thee? 22:28 Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set. 22:29 Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men. 23:1 When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what is before thee: 23:2 And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite. 23:3 Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful meat. 23:4 Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom. 23:5 Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven. 23:6 Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats: 23:7 For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart is not with thee. 23:8 The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sweet words. 23:9 Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words. 23:10 Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless: 23:11 For their redeemer is mighty; he shall plead their cause with thee. 23:12 Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge. 23:13 Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die. 23:14 Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell. 23:15 My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine. 23:16 Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things. 23:17 Let not thine heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of the LORD all the day long. 23:18 For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be cut off. 23:19 Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way. 23:20 Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh: 23:21 For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags. 23:22 Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old. 23:23 Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding. 23:24 The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him. 23:25 Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice. 23:26 My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways. 23:27 For a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow pit. 23:28 She also lieth in wait as for a prey, and increaseth the transgressors among men. 23:29 Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes? 23:30 They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine. 23:31 Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright. 23:32 At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder. 23:33 Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things. 23:34 Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast. 23:35 They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not sick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again. 24:1 Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them. 24:2 For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of mischief. 24:3 Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established: 24:4 And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches. 24:5 A wise man is strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength. 24:6 For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of counsellors there is safety. 24:7 Wisdom is too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the gate. 24:8 He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person. 24:9 The thought of foolishness is sin: and the scorner is an abomination to men. 24:10 If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small. 24:11 If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and those that are ready to be slain; 24:12 If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it? and he that keepeth thy soul, doth not he know it? and shall not he render to every man according to his works? 24:13 My son, eat thou honey, because it is good; and the honeycomb, which is sweet to thy taste: 24:14 So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul: when thou hast found it, then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not be cut off. 24:15 Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place: 24:16 For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief. 24:17 Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth: 24:18 Lest the LORD see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him. 24:19 Fret not thyself because of evil men, neither be thou envious at the wicked: 24:20 For there shall be no reward to the evil man; the candle of the wicked shall be put out. 24:21 My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: and meddle not with them th
