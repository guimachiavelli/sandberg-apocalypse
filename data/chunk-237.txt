him that will pity the poor. 28:9 He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination. 28:10 Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good things in possession. 28:11 The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out. 28:12 When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden. 28:13 He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy. 28:14 Happy is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief. 28:15 As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler over the poor people. 28:16 The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor: but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days. 28:17 A man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him. 28:18 Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once. 28:19 He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough. 28:20 A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent. 28:21 To have respect of persons is not good: for for a piece of bread that man will transgress. 28:22 He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him. 28:23 He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue. 28:24 Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression; the same is the companion of a destroyer. 28:25 He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat. 28:26 He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered. 28:27 He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse. 28:28 When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase. 29:1 He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy. 29:2 When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn. 29:3 Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth his substance. 29:4 The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it. 29:5 A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet. 29:6 In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare: but the righteous doth sing and rejoice. 29:7 The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: but the wicked regardeth not to know it. 29:8 Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise men turn away wrath. 29:9 If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, there is no rest. 29:10 The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul. 29:11 A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards. 29:12 If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked. 29:13 The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the LORD lighteneth both their eyes. 29:14 The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever. 29:15 The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame. 29:16 When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but the righteous shall see their fall. 29:17 Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul. 29:18 Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he. 29:19 A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand he will not answer. 29:20 Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more hope of a fool than of him. 29:21 He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at the length. 29:22 An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression. 29:23 A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit. 29:24 Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth cursing, and bewrayeth it not. 29:25 The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe. 29:26 Many seek the ruler's favour; but every man's judgment cometh from the LORD. 29:27 An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked. 30:1 The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal, 30:2 Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man. 30:3 I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy. 30:4 Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell? 30:5 Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him. 30:6 Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar. 30:7 Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die: 30:8 Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me: 30:9 Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain. 30:10 Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty. 30:11 There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother. 30:12 There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness. 30:13 There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up. 30:14 There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men. 30:15 The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is enough: 30:16 The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough. 30:17 The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it. 30:18 There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not: 30:19 The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid. 30:20 Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness. 30:21 For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it cannot bear: 30:22 For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat; 30:23 For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress. 30:24 There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise: 30:25 The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer; 30:26 The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks; 30:27 The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands; 30:28 The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces. 30:29 There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in going: 30:30 A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any; 30:31 A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there is no rising up. 30:32 If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth. 30:33 Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife. 31:1 The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him. 31:2 What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows? 31:3 Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings. 31:4 It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink: 31:5 Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted. 31:6 Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts. 31:7 Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more. 31:8 Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction. 31:9 Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy. 31:10 Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies. 31:11 The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil. 31:12 She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life. 31:13 She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands. 31:14 She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar. 31:15 She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens. 31:16 She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. 31:17 She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms. 31:18 She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night. 31:19 She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff. 31:20 She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy. 31:21 She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet. 31:22 She maketh herself coverings of
