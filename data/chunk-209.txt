emies triumph over me. 25:3 Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed which transgress without cause. 25:4 Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths. 25:5 Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day. 25:6 Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old. 25:7 Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O LORD. 25:8 Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the way. 25:9 The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way. 25:10 All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies. 25:11 For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it is great. 25:12 What man is he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose. 25:13 His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth. 25:14 The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant. 25:15 Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net. 25:16 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and afflicted. 25:17 The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my distresses. 25:18 Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins. 25:19 Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred. 25:20 O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee. 25:21 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee. 25:22 Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles. 26:1 Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide. 26:2 Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart. 26:3 For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth. 26:4 I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers. 26:5 I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked. 26:6 I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O LORD: 26:7 That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works. 26:8 LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth. 26:9 Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men: 26:10 In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes. 26:11 But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me. 26:12 My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD. 27:1 The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? 27:2 When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell. 27:3 Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident. 27:4 One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple. 27:5 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock. 27:6 And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD. 27:7 Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me. 27:8 When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, LORD, will I seek. 27:9 Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation. 27:10 When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will take me up. 27:11 Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies. 27:12 Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty. 27:13 I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living. 27:14 Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD. 28:1 Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me: lest, if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit. 28:2 Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle. 28:3 Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief is in their hearts. 28:4 Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their hands; render to them their desert. 28:5 Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up. 28:6 Blessed be the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications. 28:7 The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him. 28:8 The LORD is their strength, and he is the saving strength of his anointed. 28:9 Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and lift them up for ever. 29:1 Give unto the LORD, O ye mighty, give unto the LORD glory and strength. 29:2 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness. 29:3 The voice of the LORD is upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth: the LORD is upon many waters. 29:4 The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is full of majesty. 29:5 The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon. 29:6 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn. 29:7 The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire. 29:8 The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh. 29:9 The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory. 29:10 The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King for ever. 29:11 The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will bless his people with peace. 30:1 I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me. 30:2 O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me. 30:3 O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit. 30:4 Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness. 30:5 For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning. 30:6 And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved. 30:7 LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled. 30:8 I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication. 30:9 What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth? 30:10 Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper. 30:11 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness; 30:12 To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever. 31:1 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness. 31:2 Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me. 31:3 For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me. 31:4 Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou art my strength. 31:5 Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth. 31:6 I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD. 31:7 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities; 31:8 And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room. 31:9 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly. 31:10 For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed. 31:11 I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me. 31:12 I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel. 31:13 For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life. 31:14 But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God. 31:15 My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me. 31:16 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies' sake. 31:17 Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave. 31:18 Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous. 31:19 Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men! 31:20 Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the stri
