 sword, and they shall die without knowledge. 36:13 But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them. 36:14 They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean. 36:15 He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression. 36:16 Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness. 36:17 But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee. 36:18 Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee. 36:19 Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength. 36:20 Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place. 36:21 Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction. 36:22 Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him? 36:23 Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity? 36:24 Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold. 36:25 Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off. 36:26 Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out. 36:27 For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof: 36:28 Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly. 36:29 Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle? 36:30 Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea. 36:31 For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance. 36:32 With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt. 36:33 The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour. 37:1 At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place. 37:2 Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth. 37:3 He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth. 37:4 After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard. 37:5 God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend. 37:6 For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength. 37:7 He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work. 37:8 Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places. 37:9 Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north. 37:10 By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened. 37:11 Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud: 37:12 And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth. 37:13 He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy. 37:14 Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God. 37:15 Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine? 37:16 Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge? 37:17 How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind? 37:18 Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass? 37:19 Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness. 37:20 Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up. 37:21 And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them. 37:22 Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty. 37:23 Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict. 37:24 Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart. 38:1 Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, 38:2 Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? 38:3 Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me. 38:4 Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding. 38:5 Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it? 38:6 Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof; 38:7 When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? 38:8 Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb? 38:9 When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it, 38:10 And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors, 38:11 And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed? 38:12 Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the dayspring to know his place; 38:13 That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it? 38:14 It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment. 38:15 And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken. 38:16 Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth? 38:17 Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death? 38:18 Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all. 38:19 Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is the place thereof, 38:20 That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof? 38:21 Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the number of thy days is great? 38:22 Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail, 38:23 Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war? 38:24 By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east wind upon the earth? 38:25 Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder; 38:26 To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man; 38:27 To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth? 38:28 Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew? 38:29 Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it? 38:30 The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen. 38:31 Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? 38:32 Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons? 38:33 Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth? 38:34 Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee? 38:35 Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go and say unto thee, Here we are? 38:36 Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart? 38:37 Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven, 38:38 When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together? 38:39 Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions, 38:40 When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait? 38:41 Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat. 39:1 Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve? 39:2 Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth? 39:3 They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows. 39:4 Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them. 39:5 Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass? 39:6 Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings. 39:7 He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver. 39:8 The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing. 39:9 Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib? 39:10 Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee? 39:11 Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him? 39:12 Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barn? 39:13 Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich? 39:14 Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust, 39:15 And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them. 39:16 She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not her's: her labour is in vain without fear; 39:17 Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding. 39:18 What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider. 39:19 Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder? 39:20 Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible. 39:21 He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men. 39:22 He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword. 39:23 The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield. 39:24 He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believe
