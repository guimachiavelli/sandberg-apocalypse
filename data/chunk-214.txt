ther was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him: 55:13 But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance. 55:14 We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company. 55:15 Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them. 55:16 As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me. 55:17 Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice. 55:18 He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me: for there were many with me. 55:19 God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God. 55:20 He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant. 55:21 The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords. 55:22 Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved. 55:23 But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee. 56:1 Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me. 56:2 Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that fight against me, O thou most High. 56:3 What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee. 56:4 In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me. 56:5 Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against me for evil. 56:6 They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul. 56:7 Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the people, O God. 56:8 Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: are they not in thy book? 56:9 When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know; for God is for me. 56:10 In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his word. 56:11 In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me. 56:12 Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee. 56:13 For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living? 57:1 Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until these calamities be overpast. 57:2 I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all things for me. 57:3 He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth. 57:4 My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword. 57:5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above all the earth. 57:6 They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves. Selah. 57:7 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise. 57:8 Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early. 57:9 I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto thee among the nations. 57:10 For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds. 57:11 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be above all the earth. 58:1 Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men? 58:2 Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth. 58:3 The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies. 58:4 Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear; 58:5 Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely. 58:6 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD. 58:7 Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces. 58:8 As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away: like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun. 58:9 Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath. 58:10 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked. 58:11 So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth. 59:1 Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me. 59:2 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men. 59:3 For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD. 59:4 They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to help me, and behold. 59:5 Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah. 59:6 They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city. 59:7 Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their lips: for who, say they, doth hear? 59:8 But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision. 59:9 Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is my defence. 59:10 The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies. 59:11 Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield. 59:12 For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying which they speak. 59:13 Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah. 59:14 And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city. 59:15 Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied. 59:16 But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble. 59:17 Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence, and the God of my mercy. 60:1 O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again. 60:2 Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh. 60:3 Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment. 60:4 Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah. 60:5 That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and hear me. 60:6 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. 60:7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver; 60:8 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me. 60:9 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom? 60:10 Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O God, which didst not go out with our armies? 60:11 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man. 60:12 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies. 61:1 Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer. 61:2 From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I. 61:3 For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy. 61:4 I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah. 61:5 For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name. 61:6 Thou wilt prolong the king's life: and his years as many generations. 61:7 He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him. 61:8 So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows. 62:1 Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation. 62:2 He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved. 62:3 How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence. 62:4 They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah. 62:5 My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him. 62:6 He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall not be moved. 62:7 In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God. 62:8 Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah. 62:9 Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity. 62:10 Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart upon them. 62:11 God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God. 62:12 Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work. 63:1 O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is; 63:2 To see thy power and thy glory, so a
