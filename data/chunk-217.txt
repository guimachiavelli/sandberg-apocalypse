hen understood I their end. 73:18 Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction. 73:19 How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors. 73:20 As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image. 73:21 Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins. 73:22 So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee. 73:23 Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand. 73:24 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory. 73:25 Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee. 73:26 My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever. 73:27 For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee. 73:28 But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works. 74:1 O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture? 74:2 Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt. 74:3 Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary. 74:4 Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns for signs. 74:5 A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees. 74:6 But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers. 74:7 They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground. 74:8 They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land. 74:9 We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is there among us any that knoweth how long. 74:10 O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever? 74:11 Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out of thy bosom. 74:12 For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth. 74:13 Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters. 74:14 Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness. 74:15 Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers. 74:16 The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun. 74:17 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter. 74:18 Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name. 74:19 O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever. 74:20 Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty. 74:21 O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name. 74:22 Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily. 74:23 Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually. 75:1 Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks: for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare. 75:2 When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly. 75:3 The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah. 75:4 I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn: 75:5 Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck. 75:6 For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south. 75:7 But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another. 75:8 For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them. 75:9 But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. 75:10 All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted. 76:1 In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel. 76:2 In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion. 76:3 There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah. 76:4 Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey. 76:5 The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands. 76:6 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep. 76:7 Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry? 76:8 Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still, 76:9 When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah. 76:10 Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain. 76:11 Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared. 76:12 He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth. 77:1 I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me. 77:2 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted. 77:3 I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah. 77:4 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak. 77:5 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times. 77:6 I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search. 77:7 Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more? 77:8 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore? 77:9 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah. 77:10 And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High. 77:11 I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old. 77:12 I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings. 77:13 Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God? 77:14 Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people. 77:15 Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah. 77:16 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled. 77:17 The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad. 77:18 The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook. 77:19 Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known. 77:20 Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron. 78:1 Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth. 78:2 I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old: 78:3 Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us. 78:4 We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done. 78:5 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children: 78:6 That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children: 78:7 That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments: 78:8 And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God. 78:9 The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle. 78:10 They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law; 78:11 And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them. 78:12 Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. 78:13 He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap. 78:14 In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire. 78:15 He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths. 78:16 He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers. 78:17 And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness. 78:18 And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust. 78:19 Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness? 78:20 Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people? 78:21 Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel; 78:22 Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation: 78:23 Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven, 78:24 And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven. 78:25 Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full. 78:26 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind. 78:27 He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feath
