taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart. 119:112 I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even unto the end. 119:113 I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love. 119:114 Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word. 119:115 Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God. 119:116 Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope. 119:117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually. 119:118 Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit is falsehood. 119:119 Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross: therefore I love thy testimonies. 119:120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments. 119:121 I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors. 119:122 Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me. 119:123 Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness. 119:124 Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes. 119:125 I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies. 119:126 It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made void thy law. 119:127 Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold. 119:128 Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false way. 119:129 Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them. 119:130 The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple. 119:131 I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments. 119:132 Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name. 119:133 Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me. 119:134 Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy precepts. 119:135 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes. 119:136 Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law. 119:137 Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments. 119:138 Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and very faithful. 119:139 My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy words. 119:140 Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it. 119:141 I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts. 119:142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth. 119:143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy commandments are my delights. 119:144 The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me understanding, and I shall live. 119:145 I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy statutes. 119:146 I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies. 119:147 I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word. 119:148 Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word. 119:149 Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD, quicken me according to thy judgment. 119:150 They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from thy law. 119:151 Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy commandments are truth. 119:152 Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever. 119:153 Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy law. 119:154 Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy word. 119:155 Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy statutes. 119:156 Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to thy judgments. 119:157 Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not decline from thy testimonies. 119:158 I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept not thy word. 119:159 Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD, according to thy lovingkindness. 119:160 Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever. 119:161 Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy word. 119:162 I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil. 119:163 I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love. 119:164 Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments. 119:165 Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them. 119:166 LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy commandments. 119:167 My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them exceedingly. 119:168 I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways are before thee. 119:169 Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me understanding according to thy word. 119:170 Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to thy word. 119:171 My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes. 119:172 My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments are righteousness. 119:173 Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts. 119:174 I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law is my delight. 119:175 Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy judgments help me. 119:176 I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments. 120:1 In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me. 120:2 Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue. 120:3 What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue? 120:4 Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper. 120:5 Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar! 120:6 My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace. 120:7 I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war. 121:1 I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. 121:2 My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth. 121:3 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber. 121:4 Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. 121:5 The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand. 121:6 The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. 121:7 The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul. 121:8 The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore. 122:1 I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD. 122:2 Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem. 122:3 Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together: 122:4 Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD. 122:5 For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David. 122:6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee. 122:7 Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces. 122:8 For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee. 122:9 Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good. 123:1 Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens. 123:2 Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us. 123:3 Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt. 123:4 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud. 124:1 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel say; 124:2 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us: 124:3 Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us: 124:4 Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul: 124:5 Then the proud waters had gone over our soul. 124:6 Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth. 124:7 Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped. 124:8 Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth. 125:1 They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever. 125:2 As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his people from henceforth even for ever. 125:3 For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity. 125:4 Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good, and to them that are upright in their hearts. 125:5 As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace shall be upon Israel. 126:1 When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream. 126:2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them. 126:3 The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad. 126:4 Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south. 126:5 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. 126:6 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him. 127:1 Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain. 127:2 It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep. 127:3 Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the womb is his reward. 127:4 As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth. 127:5 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they s
