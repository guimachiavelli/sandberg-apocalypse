ck of my refuge. 94:23 And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall cut them off. 95:1 O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. 95:2 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms. 95:3 For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods. 95:4 In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills is his also. 95:5 The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land. 95:6 O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD our maker. 95:7 For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice, 95:8 Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness: 95:9 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work. 95:10 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways: 95:11 Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest. 96:1 O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the earth. 96:2 Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day. 96:3 Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people. 96:4 For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods. 96:5 For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made the heavens. 96:6 Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. 96:7 Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength. 96:8 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts. 96:9 O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth. 96:10 Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously. 96:11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof. 96:12 Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice 96:13 Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth. 97:1 The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof. 97:2 Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne. 97:3 A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about. 97:4 His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled. 97:5 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth. 97:6 The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory. 97:7 Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods. 97:8 Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O LORD. 97:9 For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods. 97:10 Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked. 97:11 Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart. 97:12 Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness. 98:1 O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory. 98:2 The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen. 98:3 He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. 98:4 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise. 98:5 Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm. 98:6 With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King. 98:7 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein. 98:8 Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful together 98:9 Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity. 99:1 The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between the cherubims; let the earth be moved. 99:2 The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all the people. 99:3 Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy. 99:4 The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob. 99:5 Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy. 99:6 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them. 99:7 He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them. 99:8 Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions. 99:9 Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the LORD our God is holy. 100:1 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands. 100:2 Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing. 100:3 Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. 100:4 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name. 100:5 For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations. 101:1 I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I sing. 101:2 I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart. 101:3 I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me. 101:4 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person. 101:5 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer. 101:6 Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me. 101:7 He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight. 101:8 I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD. 102:1 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee. 102:2 Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me speedily. 102:3 For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth. 102:4 My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread. 102:5 By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin. 102:6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert. 102:7 I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top. 102:8 Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad against me are sworn against me. 102:9 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping. 102:10 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down. 102:11 My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass. 102:12 But thou, O LORD, shall endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations. 102:13 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come. 102:14 For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof. 102:15 So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory. 102:16 When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory. 102:17 He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer. 102:18 This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD. 102:19 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth; 102:20 To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death; 102:21 To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem; 102:22 When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD. 102:23 He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days. 102:24 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all generations. 102:25 Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands. 102:26 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: 102:27 But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end. 102:28 The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee. 103:1 Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name. 103:2 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: 103:3 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases; 103:4 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies; 103:5 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's. 103:6 The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed. 103:7 He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel. 103:8 The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy. 10
