 10:18 To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress. 11:1 In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain? 11:2 For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart. 11:3 If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do? 11:4 The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men. 11:5 The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth. 11:6 Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup. 11:7 For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright. 12:1 Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men. 12:2 They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak. 12:3 The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things: 12:4 Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us? 12:5 For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him. 12:6 The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. 12:7 Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever. 12:8 The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted. 13:1 How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me? 13:2 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me? 13:3 Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death; 13:4 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved. 13:5 But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation. 13:6 I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with me. 14:1 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good. 14:2 The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God. 14:3 They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one. 14:4 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD. 14:5 There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous. 14:6 Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is his refuge. 14:7 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad. 15:1 Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill? 15:2 He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart. 15:3 He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour. 15:4 In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not. 15:5 He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved. 16:1 Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust. 16:2 O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord: my goodness extendeth not to thee; 16:3 But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight. 16:4 Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips. 16:5 The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot. 16:6 The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage. 16:7 I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons. 16:8 I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. 16:9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope. 16:10 For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. 16:11 Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore. 17:1 Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips. 17:2 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal. 17:3 Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress. 17:4 Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer. 17:5 Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not. 17:6 I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech. 17:7 Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them. 17:8 Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings, 17:9 From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who compass me about. 17:10 They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly. 17:11 They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth; 17:12 Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places. 17:13 Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy sword: 17:14 From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes. 17:15 As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness. 18:1 I will love thee, O LORD, my strength. 18:2 The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower. 18:3 I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies. 18:4 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid. 18:5 The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me. 18:6 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears. 18:7 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth. 18:8 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it. 18:9 He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his feet. 18:10 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind. 18:11 He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies. 18:12 At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire. 18:13 The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire. 18:14 Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them. 18:15 Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils. 18:16 He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters. 18:17 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me. 18:18 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay. 18:19 He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me. 18:20 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me. 18:21 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God. 18:22 For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me. 18:23 I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity. 18:24 Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight. 18:25 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright; 18:26 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward. 18:27 For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks. 18:28 For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness. 18:29 For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall. 18:30 As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him. 18:31 For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God? 18:32 It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect. 18:33 He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high places. 18:34 He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms. 18:35 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great. 18:36 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip. 18:37 I have purs
