hall speak with the enemies in the gate. 128:1 Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his ways. 128:2 For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee. 128:3 Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table. 128:4 Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD. 128:5 The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life. 128:6 Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon Israel. 129:1 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say: 129:2 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me. 129:3 The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows. 129:4 The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked. 129:5 Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion. 129:6 Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up: 129:7 Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom. 129:8 Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD. 130:1 Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD. 130:2 Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. 130:3 If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? 130:4 But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared. 130:5 I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope. 130:6 My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning. 130:7 Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption. 130:8 And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities. 131:1 Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me. 131:2 Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child. 131:3 Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever. 132:1 Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions: 132:2 How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob; 132:3 Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed; 132:4 I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids, 132:5 Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob. 132:6 Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood. 132:7 We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool. 132:8 Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength. 132:9 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy. 132:10 For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed. 132:11 The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne. 132:12 If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore. 132:13 For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation. 132:14 This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it. 132:15 I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread. 132:16 I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy. 132:17 There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed. 132:18 His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish. 133:1 Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! 133:2 It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments; 133:3 As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even life for evermore. 134:1 Behold, bless ye the LORD, all ye servants of the LORD, which by night stand in the house of the LORD. 134:2 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the LORD. 134:3 The LORD that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion. 135:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise him, O ye servants of the LORD. 135:2 Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God. 135:3 Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant. 135:4 For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure. 135:5 For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above all gods. 135:6 Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places. 135:7 He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries. 135:8 Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast. 135:9 Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants. 135:10 Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings; 135:11 Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan: 135:12 And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people. 135:13 Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations. 135:14 For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants. 135:15 The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's hands. 135:16 They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not; 135:17 They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths. 135:18 They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that trusteth in them. 135:19 Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of Aaron: 135:20 Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless the LORD. 135:21 Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD. 136:1 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. 136:2 O give thanks unto the God of gods: for his mercy endureth for ever. 136:3 O give thanks to the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for ever. 136:4 To him who alone doeth great wonders: for his mercy endureth for ever. 136:5 To him that by wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy endureth for ever. 136:6 To him that stretched out the earth above the waters: for his mercy endureth for ever. 136:7 To him that made great lights: for his mercy endureth for ever: 136:8 The sun to rule by day: for his mercy endureth for ever: 136:9 The moon and stars to rule by night: for his mercy endureth for ever. 136:10 To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn: for his mercy endureth for ever: 136:11 And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy endureth for ever: 136:12 With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm: for his mercy endureth for ever. 136:13 To him which divided the Red sea into parts: for his mercy endureth for ever: 136:14 And made Israel to pass through the midst of it: for his mercy endureth for ever: 136:15 But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea: for his mercy endureth for ever. 136:16 To him which led his people through the wilderness: for his mercy endureth for ever. 136:17 To him which smote great kings: for his mercy endureth for ever: 136:18 And slew famous kings: for his mercy endureth for ever: 136:19 Sihon king of the Amorites: for his mercy endureth for ever: 136:20 And Og the king of Bashan: for his mercy endureth for ever: 136:21 And gave their land for an heritage: for his mercy endureth for ever: 136:22 Even an heritage unto Israel his servant: for his mercy endureth for ever. 136:23 Who remembered us in our low estate: for his mercy endureth for ever: 136:24 And hath redeemed us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth for ever. 136:25 Who giveth food to all flesh: for his mercy endureth for ever. 136:26 O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy endureth for ever. 137:1 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion. 137:2 We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof. 137:3 For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion. 137:4 How shall we sing the LORD's song in a strange land? 137:5 If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. 137:6 If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy. 137:7 Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof. 137:8 O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us. 137:9 Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones. 138:1 I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise unto thee. 138:2 I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name. 138:3 In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul. 138:4 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when they hear the words of thy mouth. 138:5 Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD: for great is the glory of the LORD. 138:6 Though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar off. 138:7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, an
