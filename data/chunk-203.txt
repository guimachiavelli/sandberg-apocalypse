Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion. 32:11 Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say. 32:12 Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words: 32:13 Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man. 32:14 Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches. 32:15 They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking. 32:16 When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;) 32:17 I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion. 32:18 For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me. 32:19 Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles. 32:20 I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer. 32:21 Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man. 32:22 For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away. 33:1 Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words. 33:2 Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth. 33:3 My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly. 33:4 The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life. 33:5 If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up. 33:6 Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay. 33:7 Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee. 33:8 Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying, 33:9 I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me. 33:10 Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy, 33:11 He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths. 33:12 Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man. 33:13 Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters. 33:14 For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not. 33:15 In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed; 33:16 Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction, 33:17 That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man. 33:18 He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword. 33:19 He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain: 33:20 So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat. 33:21 His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out. 33:22 Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers. 33:23 If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness: 33:24 Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom. 33:25 His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth: 33:26 He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness. 33:27 He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not; 33:28 He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light. 33:29 Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man, 33:30 To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living. 33:31 Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak. 33:32 If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee. 33:33 If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom. 34:1 Furthermore Elihu answered and said, 34:2 Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge. 34:3 For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat. 34:4 Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good. 34:5 For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment. 34:6 Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression. 34:7 What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water? 34:8 Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men. 34:9 For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God. 34:10 Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity. 34:11 For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways. 34:12 Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment. 34:13 Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world? 34:14 If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath; 34:15 All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust. 34:16 If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words. 34:17 Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just? 34:18 Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly? 34:19 How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands. 34:20 In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand. 34:21 For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings. 34:22 There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves. 34:23 For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God. 34:24 He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead. 34:25 Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed. 34:26 He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others; 34:27 Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways: 34:28 So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted. 34:29 When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only: 34:30 That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared. 34:31 Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more: 34:32 That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more. 34:33 Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest. 34:34 Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me. 34:35 Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom. 34:36 My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men. 34:37 For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God. 35:1 Elihu spake moreover, and said, 35:2 Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's? 35:3 For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin? 35:4 I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee. 35:5 Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou. 35:6 If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him? 35:7 If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand? 35:8 Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man. 35:9 By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty. 35:10 But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night; 35:11 Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven? 35:12 There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men. 35:13 Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it. 35:14 Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him. 35:15 But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity: 35:16 Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge. 36:1 Elihu also proceeded, and said, 36:2 Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf. 36:3 I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. 36:4 For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee. 36:5 Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom. 36:6 He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor. 36:7 He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted. 36:8 And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction; 36:9 Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded. 36:10 He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity. 36:11 If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures. 36:12 But if they obey not, they shall perish by the
