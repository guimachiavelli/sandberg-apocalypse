shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD. 118:18 The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death. 118:19 Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the LORD: 118:20 This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter. 118:21 I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation. 118:22 The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner. 118:23 This is the LORD's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes. 118:24 This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it. 118:25 Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send now prosperity. 118:26 Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD. 118:27 God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar. 118:28 Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee. 118:29 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. 119:1 Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the LORD. 119:2 Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him with the whole heart. 119:3 They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways. 119:4 Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently. 119:5 O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes! 119:6 Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments. 119:7 I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments. 119:8 I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly. 119:9 Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word. 119:10 With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments. 119:11 Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee. 119:12 Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes. 119:13 With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth. 119:14 I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches. 119:15 I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways. 119:16 I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word. 119:17 Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep thy word. 119:18 Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law. 119:19 I am a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from me. 119:20 My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all times. 119:21 Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from thy commandments. 119:22 Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies. 119:23 Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes. 119:24 Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors. 119:25 My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to thy word. 119:26 I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy statutes. 119:27 Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk of thy wondrous works. 119:28 My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto thy word. 119:29 Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law graciously. 119:30 I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid before me. 119:31 I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to shame. 119:32 I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart. 119:33 Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it unto the end. 119:34 Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart. 119:35 Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I delight. 119:36 Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness. 119:37 Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me in thy way. 119:38 Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear. 119:39 Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are good. 119:40 Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy righteousness. 119:41 Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation, according to thy word. 119:42 So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word. 119:43 And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments. 119:44 So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever. 119:45 And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts. 119:46 I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed. 119:47 And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved. 119:48 My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes. 119:49 Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope. 119:50 This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath quickened me. 119:51 The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not declined from thy law. 119:52 I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted myself. 119:53 Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law. 119:54 Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage. 119:55 I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept thy law. 119:56 This I had, because I kept thy precepts. 119:57 Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy words. 119:58 I intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto me according to thy word. 119:59 I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies. 119:60 I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments. 119:61 The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not forgotten thy law. 119:62 At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments. 119:63 I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts. 119:64 The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes. 119:65 Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto thy word. 119:66 Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments. 119:67 Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word. 119:68 Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes. 119:69 The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart. 119:70 Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law. 119:71 It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes. 119:72 The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver. 119:73 Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments. 119:74 They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word. 119:75 I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me. 119:76 Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant. 119:77 Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law is my delight. 119:78 Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts. 119:79 Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies. 119:80 Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed. 119:81 My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word. 119:82 Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me? 119:83 For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not forget thy statutes. 119:84 How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me? 119:85 The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy law. 119:86 All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me. 119:87 They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts. 119:88 Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth. 119:89 For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven. 119:90 Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth. 119:91 They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all are thy servants. 119:92 Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction. 119:93 I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me. 119:94 I am thine, save me: for I have sought thy precepts. 119:95 The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will consider thy testimonies. 119:96 I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is exceeding broad. 119:97 O how I love thy law! it is my meditation all the day. 119:98 Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me. 119:99 I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation. 119:100 I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts. 119:101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word. 119:102 I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me. 119:103 How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth! 119:104 Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way. 119:105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. 119:106 I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments. 119:107 I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto thy word. 119:108 Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me thy judgments. 119:109 My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law. 119:110 The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts. 119:111 Thy testimonies have I
