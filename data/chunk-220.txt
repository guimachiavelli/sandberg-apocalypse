ine arm also shall strengthen him. 89:22 The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him. 89:23 And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him. 89:24 But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted. 89:25 I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers. 89:26 He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation. 89:27 Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth. 89:28 My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him. 89:29 His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven. 89:30 If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments; 89:31 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; 89:32 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes. 89:33 Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail. 89:34 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. 89:35 Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David. 89:36 His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me. 89:37 It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven. Selah. 89:38 But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed. 89:39 Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground. 89:40 Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin. 89:41 All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours. 89:42 Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice. 89:43 Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle. 89:44 Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground. 89:45 The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah. 89:46 How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire? 89:47 Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain? 89:48 What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah. 89:49 Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarest unto David in thy truth? 89:50 Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people; 89:51 Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed. 89:52 Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen. 90:1 Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations. 90:2 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God. 90:3 Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men. 90:4 For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night. 90:5 Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning they are like grass which groweth up. 90:6 In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth. 90:7 For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled. 90:8 Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance. 90:9 For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale that is told. 90:10 The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away. 90:11 Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath. 90:12 So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom. 90:13 Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants. 90:14 O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days. 90:15 Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil. 90:16 Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children. 90:17 And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it. 91:1 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. 91:2 I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust. 91:3 Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. 91:4 He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler. 91:5 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; 91:6 Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. 91:7 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee. 91:8 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked. 91:9 Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation; 91:10 There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. 91:11 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. 91:12 They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone. 91:13 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet. 91:14 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name. 91:15 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him. 91:16 With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation. 92:1 It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High: 92:2 To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night, 92:3 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound. 92:4 For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands. 92:5 O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep. 92:6 A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this. 92:7 When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever: 92:8 But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore. 92:9 For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered. 92:10 But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil. 92:11 Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me. 92:12 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. 92:13 Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God. 92:14 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing; 92:15 To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him. 93:1 The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved. 93:2 Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting. 93:3 The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves. 93:4 The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea. 93:5 Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever. 94:1 O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself. 94:2 Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud. 94:3 LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph? 94:4 How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves? 94:5 They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage. 94:6 They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless. 94:7 Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it. 94:8 Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will ye be wise? 94:9 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see? 94:10 He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know? 94:11 The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity. 94:12 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of thy law; 94:13 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked. 94:14 For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance. 94:15 But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it. 94:16 Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity? 94:17 Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence. 94:18 When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up. 94:19 In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul. 94:20 Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law? 94:21 They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood. 94:22 But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the ro
