s I have seen thee in the sanctuary. 63:3 Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee. 63:4 Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name. 63:5 My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips: 63:6 When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches. 63:7 Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice. 63:8 My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me. 63:9 But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower parts of the earth. 63:10 They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes. 63:11 But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped. 64:1 Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy. 64:2 Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity: 64:3 Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words: 64:4 That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not. 64:5 They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them? 64:6 They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep. 64:7 But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded. 64:8 So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away. 64:9 And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing. 64:10 The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory. 65:1 Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed. 65:2 O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come. 65:3 Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away. 65:4 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple. 65:5 By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the sea: 65:6 Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded with power: 65:7 Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people. 65:8 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice. 65:9 Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, which is full of water: thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it. 65:10 Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the springing thereof. 65:11 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop fatness. 65:12 They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the little hills rejoice on every side. 65:13 The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing. 66:1 Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands: 66:2 Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious. 66:3 Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee. 66:4 All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they shall sing to thy name. Selah. 66:5 Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing toward the children of men. 66:6 He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood on foot: there did we rejoice in him. 66:7 He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah. 66:8 O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard: 66:9 Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved. 66:10 For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is tried. 66:11 Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon our loins. 66:12 Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place. 66:13 I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows, 66:14 Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble. 66:15 I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah. 66:16 Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my soul. 66:17 I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue. 66:18 If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me: 66:19 But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer. 66:20 Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me. 67:1 God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to shine upon us; Selah. 67:2 That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations. 67:3 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee. 67:4 O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth. Selah. 67:5 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee. 67:6 Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us. 67:7 God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him. 68:1 Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him. 68:2 As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God. 68:3 But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea, let them exceedingly rejoice. 68:4 Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him. 68:5 A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in his holy habitation. 68:6 God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry land. 68:7 O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah: 68:8 The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel. 68:9 Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary. 68:10 Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor. 68:11 The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that published it. 68:12 Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home divided the spoil. 68:13 Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold. 68:14 When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as snow in Salmon. 68:15 The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the hill of Bashan. 68:16 Why leap ye, ye high hills? this is the hill which God desireth to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell in it for ever. 68:17 The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place. 68:18 Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell among them. 68:19 Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our salvation. Selah. 68:20 He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto GOD the Lord belong the issues from death. 68:21 But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses. 68:22 The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my people again from the depths of the sea: 68:23 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, and the tongue of thy dogs in the same. 68:24 They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary. 68:25 The singers went before, the players on instruments followed after; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels. 68:26 Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the fountain of Israel. 68:27 There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of Judah and their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali. 68:28 Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us. 68:29 Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee. 68:30 Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, till every one submit himself with pieces of silver: scatter thou the people that delight in war. 68:31 Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God. 68:32 Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah: 68:33 To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of old; lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice. 68:34 Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel, and his strength is in the clouds. 68:35 O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God. 69:1 Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul. 69:2 I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me. 69:3 I
