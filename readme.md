# The Song of the Apocalypse

In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, and God was the Word, and God wrote the Word, and the written Word was the Bible, and the Word was made flesh. By destroying the Word we destroy God, by destroying the Word we destroy flesh. Listen to the sound of each word as it is erased from creation.
