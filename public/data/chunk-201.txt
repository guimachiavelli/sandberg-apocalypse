s of thine hands. 23:1 Then Job answered and said, 23:2 Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning. 23:3 Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat! 23:4 I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments. 23:5 I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me. 23:6 Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me. 23:7 There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge. 23:8 Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him: 23:9 On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him: 23:10 But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold. 23:11 My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined. 23:12 Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food. 23:13 But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth. 23:14 For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him. 23:15 Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him. 23:16 For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me: 23:17 Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he covered the darkness from my face. 24:1 Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days? 24:2 Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof. 24:3 They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge. 24:4 They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together. 24:5 Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children. 24:6 They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked. 24:7 They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold. 24:8 They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter. 24:9 They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor. 24:10 They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry; 24:11 Which make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst. 24:12 Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them. 24:13 They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof. 24:14 The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief. 24:15 The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face. 24:16 In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light. 24:17 For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death. 24:18 He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards. 24:19 Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave those which have sinned. 24:20 The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree. 24:21 He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow. 24:22 He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life. 24:23 Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways. 24:24 They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn. 24:25 And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth? 25:1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 25:2 Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high places. 25:3 Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise? 25:4 How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman? 25:5 Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight. 25:6 How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which is a worm? 26:1 But Job answered and said, 26:2 How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength? 26:3 How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is? 26:4 To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee? 26:5 Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof. 26:6 Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering. 26:7 He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing. 26:8 He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them. 26:9 He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it. 26:10 He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end. 26:11 The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof. 26:12 He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud. 26:13 By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent. 26:14 Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand? 27:1 Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, 27:2 As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul; 27:3 All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils; 27:4 My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit. 27:5 God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me. 27:6 My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live. 27:7 Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous. 27:8 For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul? 27:9 Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him? 27:10 Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God? 27:11 I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal. 27:12 Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus altogether vain? 27:13 This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty. 27:14 If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread. 27:15 Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep. 27:16 Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay; 27:17 He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver. 27:18 He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper maketh. 27:19 The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he is not. 27:20 Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night. 27:21 The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place. 27:22 For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand. 27:23 Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place. 28:1 Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it. 28:2 Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone. 28:3 He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death. 28:4 The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men. 28:5 As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire. 28:6 The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold. 28:7 There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not seen: 28:8 The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it. 28:9 He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots. 28:10 He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing. 28:11 He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light. 28:12 But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding? 28:13 Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living. 28:14 The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me. 28:15 It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof. 28:16 It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire. 28:17 The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold. 28:18 No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above rubies. 28:19 The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold. 28:20 Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding? 28:21 Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air. 28:22 Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears. 28:23 God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof. 28:24 For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whol
