water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with. 17:15 He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both are abomination to the LORD. 17:16 Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it? 17:17 A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity. 17:18 A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh surety in the presence of his friend. 17:19 He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction. 17:20 He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief. 17:21 He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy. 17:22 A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones. 17:23 A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment. 17:24 Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth. 17:25 A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him. 17:26 Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for equity. 17:27 He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit. 17:28 Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding. 18:1 Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom. 18:2 A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself. 18:3 When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach. 18:4 The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters, and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook. 18:5 It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment. 18:6 A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes. 18:7 A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his soul. 18:8 The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly. 18:9 He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster. 18:10 The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe. 18:11 The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit. 18:12 Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility. 18:13 He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him. 18:14 The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear? 18:15 The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge. 18:16 A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men. 18:17 He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him. 18:18 The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty. 18:19 A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a castle. 18:20 A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled. 18:21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof. 18:22 Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD. 18:23 The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly. 18:24 A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother. 19:1 Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool. 19:2 Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth. 19:3 The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD. 19:4 Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour. 19:5 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall not escape. 19:6 Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts. 19:7 All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to him. 19:8 He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good. 19:9 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall perish. 19:10 Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes. 19:11 The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his glory to pass over a transgression. 19:12 The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour is as dew upon the grass. 19:13 A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping. 19:14 House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife is from the LORD. 19:15 Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger. 19:16 He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but he that despiseth his ways shall die. 19:17 He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again. 19:18 Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying. 19:19 A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver him, yet thou must do it again. 19:20 Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end. 19:21 There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand. 19:22 The desire of a man is his kindness: and a poor man is better than a liar. 19:23 The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil. 19:24 A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again. 19:25 Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge. 19:26 He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach. 19:27 Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge. 19:28 An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity. 19:29 Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools. 20:1 Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise. 20:2 The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion: whoso provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul. 20:3 It is an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be meddling. 20:4 The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing. 20:5 Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out. 20:6 Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find? 20:7 The just man walketh in his integrity: his children are blessed after him. 20:8 A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes. 20:9 Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin? 20:10 Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike abomination to the LORD. 20:11 Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right. 20:12 The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them. 20:13 Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread. 20:14 It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth. 20:15 There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel. 20:16 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman. 20:17 Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel. 20:18 Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war. 20:19 He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips. 20:20 Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness. 20:21 An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed. 20:22 Say not thou, I will recompense evil; but wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee. 20:23 Divers weights are an abomination unto the LORD; and a false balance is not good. 20:24 Man's goings are of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way? 20:25 It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and after vows to make enquiry. 20:26 A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them. 20:27 The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly. 20:28 Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy. 20:29 The glory of young men is their strength: and the beauty of old men is the grey head. 20:30 The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so do stripes the inward parts of the belly. 21:1 The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will. 21:2 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the LORD pondereth the hearts. 21:3 To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice. 21:4 An high look, and a proud heart, and the plowing of the wicked, is sin. 21:5 The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but of every one that is hasty only to want. 21:6 The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death. 21:7 The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment. 21:8 The way of man is froward and strange: but as for the pure, his work
