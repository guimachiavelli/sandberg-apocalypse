e LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it. 10:23 It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding hath wisdom. 10:24 The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted. 10:25 As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more: but the righteous is an everlasting foundation. 10:26 As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to them that send him. 10:27 The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened. 10:28 The hope of the righteous shall be gladness: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish. 10:29 The way of the LORD is strength to the upright: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity. 10:30 The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth. 10:31 The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward tongue shall be cut out. 10:32 The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness. 11:1 A false balance is abomination to the LORD: but a just weight is his delight. 11:2 When pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly is wisdom. 11:3 The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them. 11:4 Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivereth from death. 11:5 The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness. 11:6 The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness. 11:7 When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish: and the hope of unjust men perisheth. 11:8 The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead. 11:9 An hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but through knowledge shall the just be delivered. 11:10 When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and when the wicked perish, there is shouting. 11:11 By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked. 11:12 He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man of understanding holdeth his peace. 11:13 A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter. 11:14 Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellors there is safety. 11:15 He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it: and he that hateth suretiship is sure. 11:16 A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong men retain riches. 11:17 The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh. 11:18 The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward. 11:19 As righteousness tendeth to life: so he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death. 11:20 They that are of a froward heart are abomination to the LORD: but such as are upright in their way are his delight. 11:21 Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered. 11:22 As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman which is without discretion. 11:23 The desire of the righteous is only good: but the expectation of the wicked is wrath. 11:24 There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty. 11:25 The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself. 11:26 He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it. 11:27 He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him. 11:28 He that trusteth in his riches shall fall; but the righteous shall flourish as a branch. 11:29 He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart. 11:30 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is wise. 11:31 Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much more the wicked and the sinner. 12:1 Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth reproof is brutish. 12:2 A good man obtaineth favour of the LORD: but a man of wicked devices will he condemn. 12:3 A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of the righteous shall not be moved. 12:4 A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband: but she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones. 12:5 The thoughts of the righteous are right: but the counsels of the wicked are deceit. 12:6 The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood: but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them. 12:7 The wicked are overthrown, and are not: but the house of the righteous shall stand. 12:8 A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised. 12:9 He that is despised, and hath a servant, is better than he that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread. 12:10 A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel. 12:11 He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he that followeth vain persons is void of understanding. 12:12 The wicked desireth the net of evil men: but the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit. 12:13 The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips: but the just shall come out of trouble. 12:14 A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth: and the recompence of a man's hands shall be rendered unto him. 12:15 The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise. 12:16 A fool's wrath is presently known: but a prudent man covereth shame. 12:17 He that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness: but a false witness deceit. 12:18 There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the tongue of the wise is health. 12:19 The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue is but for a moment. 12:20 Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the counsellors of peace is joy. 12:21 There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall be filled with mischief. 12:22 Lying lips are abomination to the LORD: but they that deal truly are his delight. 12:23 A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness. 12:24 The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful shall be under tribute. 12:25 Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word maketh it glad. 12:26 The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour: but the way of the wicked seduceth them. 12:27 The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting: but the substance of a diligent man is precious. 12:28 In the way of righteousness is life: and in the pathway thereof there is no death. 13:1 A wise son heareth his father's instruction: but a scorner heareth not rebuke. 13:2 A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth: but the soul of the transgressors shall eat violence. 13:3 He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life: but he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction. 13:4 The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing: but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat. 13:5 A righteous man hateth lying: but a wicked man is loathsome, and cometh to shame. 13:6 Righteousness keepeth him that is upright in the way: but wickedness overthroweth the sinner. 13:7 There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing: there is that maketh himself poor, yet hath great riches. 13:8 The ransom of a man's life are his riches: but the poor heareth not rebuke. 13:9 The light of the righteous rejoiceth: but the lamp of the wicked shall be put out. 13:10 Only by pride cometh contention: but with the well advised is wisdom. 13:11 Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished: but he that gathereth by labour shall increase. 13:12 Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life. 13:13 Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded. 13:14 The law of the wise is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death. 13:15 Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors is hard. 13:16 Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge: but a fool layeth open his folly. 13:17 A wicked messenger falleth into mischief: but a faithful ambassador is health. 13:18 Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction: but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured. 13:19 The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul: but it is abomination to fools to depart from evil. 13:20 He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed. 13:21 Evil pursueth sinners: but to the righteous good shall be repayed. 13:22 A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children: and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just. 13:23 Much food is in the tillage of the poor: but there is that is destroyed for want of judgment. 13:24 He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes. 13:25 The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul: but the belly of the wicked shall want. 14:1 Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands. 14:2 He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD: but he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him. 14:3 In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride: but the lips of the wise shall preserve them. 14:4 Where no oxen are, the crib is clean: but much increase is by the strength of the ox. 14:5 A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will utter lies. 14:6 A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not: but knowledge is easy unto him that understandeth. 14:7 Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge. 14:8 The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way: but
