e heaven; 28:25 To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure. 28:26 When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder: 28:27 Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out. 28:28 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding. 29:1 Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, 29:2 Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me; 29:3 When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkness; 29:4 As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle; 29:5 When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me; 29:6 When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil; 29:7 When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street! 29:8 The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up. 29:9 The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth. 29:10 The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth. 29:11 When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me: 29:12 Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him. 29:13 The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy. 29:14 I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem. 29:15 I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame. 29:16 I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out. 29:17 And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth. 29:18 Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand. 29:19 My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch. 29:20 My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand. 29:21 Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel. 29:22 After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them. 29:23 And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain. 29:24 If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down. 29:25 I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners. 30:1 But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock. 30:2 Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age was perished? 30:3 For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste. 30:4 Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their meat. 30:5 They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as after a thief;) 30:6 To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks. 30:7 Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together. 30:8 They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth. 30:9 And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword. 30:10 They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face. 30:11 Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me. 30:12 Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction. 30:13 They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper. 30:14 They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me. 30:15 Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud. 30:16 And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me. 30:17 My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest. 30:18 By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat. 30:19 He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes. 30:20 I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not. 30:21 Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me. 30:22 Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance. 30:23 For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living. 30:24 Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction. 30:25 Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the poor? 30:26 When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I waited for light, there came darkness. 30:27 My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me. 30:28 I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation. 30:29 I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls. 30:30 My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat. 30:31 My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep. 31:1 I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid? 31:2 For what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high? 31:3 Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity? 31:4 Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps? 31:5 If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit; 31:6 Let me be weighed in an even balance that God may know mine integrity. 31:7 If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands; 31:8 Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out. 31:9 If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid wait at my neighbour's door; 31:10 Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her. 31:11 For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges. 31:12 For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase. 31:13 If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me; 31:14 What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him? 31:15 Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb? 31:16 If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail; 31:17 Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof; 31:18 (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;) 31:19 If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering; 31:20 If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep; 31:21 If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate: 31:22 Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone. 31:23 For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure. 31:24 If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence; 31:25 If I rejoice because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten much; 31:26 If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness; 31:27 And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand: 31:28 This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above. 31:29 If I rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him: 31:30 Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul. 31:31 If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied. 31:32 The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors to the traveller. 31:33 If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom: 31:34 Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door? 31:35 Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book. 31:36 Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me. 31:37 I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him. 31:38 If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain; 31:39 If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life: 31:40 Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended. 32:1 So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. 32:2 Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God. 32:3 Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job. 32:4 Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he. 32:5 When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled. 32:6 And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion. 32:7 I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom. 32:8 But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding. 32:9 Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment. 32:10 Therefore I said,
