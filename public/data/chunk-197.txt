that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together! 6:3 For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up. 6:4 For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me. 6:5 Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder? 6:6 Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg? 6:7 The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat. 6:8 Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for! 6:9 Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off! 6:10 Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One. 6:11 What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life? 6:12 Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass? 6:13 Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me? 6:14 To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty. 6:15 My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away; 6:16 Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid: 6:17 What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place. 6:18 The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish. 6:19 The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them. 6:20 They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed. 6:21 For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid. 6:22 Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance? 6:23 Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty? 6:24 Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred. 6:25 How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove? 6:26 Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind? 6:27 Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend. 6:28 Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie. 6:29 Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it. 6:30 Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things? 7:1 Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling? 7:2 As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work: 7:3 So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me. 7:4 When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day. 7:5 My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome. 7:6 My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope. 7:7 O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good. 7:8 The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not. 7:9 As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more. 7:10 He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more. 7:11 Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. 7:12 Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me? 7:13 When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaints; 7:14 Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions: 7:15 So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life. 7:16 I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity. 7:17 What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him? 7:18 And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment? 7:19 How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle? 7:20 I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself? 7:21 And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be. 8:1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 8:2 How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind? 8:3 Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice? 8:4 If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression; 8:5 If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty; 8:6 If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous. 8:7 Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase. 8:8 For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers: 8:9 (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:) 8:10 Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart? 8:11 Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water? 8:12 Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb. 8:13 So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish: 8:14 Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web. 8:15 He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure. 8:16 He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden. 8:17 His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones. 8:18 If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee. 8:19 Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow. 8:20 Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers: 8:21 Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing. 8:22 They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought. 9:1 Then Job answered and said, 9:2 I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God? 9:3 If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand. 9:4 He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered? 9:5 Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger. 9:6 Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble. 9:7 Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars. 9:8 Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea. 9:9 Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south. 9:10 Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number. 9:11 Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not. 9:12 Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou? 9:13 If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him. 9:14 How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him? 9:15 Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge. 9:16 If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice. 9:17 For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause. 9:18 He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness. 9:19 If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead? 9:20 If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse. 9:21 Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life. 9:22 This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked. 9:23 If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent. 9:24 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he? 9:25 Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good. 9:26 They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey. 9:27 If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself: 9:28 I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent. 9:29 If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain? 9:30 If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean; 9:31 Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me. 9:32 For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment. 9:33 Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both. 9:34 Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me: 9:35 Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me. 10:1 My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. 10:2 I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me. 10:3 Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked? 10:4 Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth? 10:5 Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man's days, 10:6 T
