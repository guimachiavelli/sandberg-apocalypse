ued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed. 18:38 I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet. 18:39 For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me. 18:40 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me. 18:41 They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the LORD, but he answered them not. 18:42 Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets. 18:43 Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me. 18:44 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me. 18:45 The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places. 18:46 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted. 18:47 It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me. 18:48 He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man. 18:49 Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name. 18:50 Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore. 19:1 The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork. 19:2 Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. 19:3 There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard. 19:4 Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun, 19:5 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race. 19:6 His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof. 19:7 The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple. 19:8 The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes. 19:9 The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether. 19:10 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. 19:11 Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward. 19:12 Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults. 19:13 Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression. 19:14 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer. 20:1 The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee; 20:2 Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion; 20:3 Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah. 20:4 Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel. 20:5 We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions. 20:6 Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand. 20:7 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD our God. 20:8 They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright. 20:9 Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call. 21:1 The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice! 21:2 Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah. 21:3 For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head. 21:4 He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever. 21:5 His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him. 21:6 For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance. 21:7 For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved. 21:8 Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee. 21:9 Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them. 21:10 Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men. 21:11 For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform. 21:12 Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them. 21:13 Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so will we sing and praise thy power. 22:1 My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring? 22:2 O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent. 22:3 But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel. 22:4 Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them. 22:5 They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded. 22:6 But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people. 22:7 All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, 22:8 He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him. 22:9 But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts. 22:10 I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my mother's belly. 22:11 Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help. 22:12 Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round. 22:13 They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion. 22:14 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels. 22:15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death. 22:16 For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet. 22:17 I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me. 22:18 They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture. 22:19 But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee to help me. 22:20 Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog. 22:21 Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns. 22:22 I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee. 22:23 Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel. 22:24 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard. 22:25 My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him. 22:26 The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever. 22:27 All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee. 22:28 For the kingdom is the LORD's: and he is the governor among the nations. 22:29 All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul. 22:30 A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation. 22:31 They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done this. 23:1 The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. 23:2 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. 23:3 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. 23:4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. 23:5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. 23:6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever. 24:1 The earth is the LORD's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein. 24:2 For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods. 24:3 Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in his holy place? 24:4 He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully. 24:5 He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation. 24:6 This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah. 24:7 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in. 24:8 Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle. 24:9 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in. 24:10 Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah. 25:1 Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul. 25:2 O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine en
