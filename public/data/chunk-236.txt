at are given to change: 24:22 For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both? 24:23 These things also belong to the wise. It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment. 24:24 He that saith unto the wicked, Thou are righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him: 24:25 But to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them. 24:26 Every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer. 24:27 Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house. 24:28 Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive not with thy lips. 24:29 Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work. 24:30 I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding; 24:31 And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down. 24:32 Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and received instruction. 24:33 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: 24:34 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man. 25:1 These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out. 25:2 It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter. 25:3 The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable. 25:4 Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer. 25:5 Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness. 25:6 Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men: 25:7 For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen. 25:8 Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame. 25:9 Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not a secret to another: 25:10 Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away. 25:11 A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver. 25:12 As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear. 25:13 As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters. 25:14 Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain. 25:15 By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone. 25:16 Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it. 25:17 Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee. 25:18 A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow. 25:19 Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint. 25:20 As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart. 25:21 If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink: 25:22 For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee. 25:23 The north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue. 25:24 It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house. 25:25 As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country. 25:26 A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring. 25:27 It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their own glory is not glory. 25:28 He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls. 26:1 As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly for a fool. 26:2 As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come. 26:3 A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool's back. 26:4 Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him. 26:5 Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit. 26:6 He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, and drinketh damage. 26:7 The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the mouth of fools. 26:8 As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth honour to a fool. 26:9 As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the mouths of fools. 26:10 The great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors. 26:11 As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his folly. 26:12 Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope of a fool than of him. 26:13 The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets. 26:14 As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon his bed. 26:15 The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth. 26:16 The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason. 26:17 He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears. 26:18 As a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death, 26:19 So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport? 26:20 Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is no talebearer, the strife ceaseth. 26:21 As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a contentious man to kindle strife. 26:22 The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly. 26:23 Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with silver dross. 26:24 He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him; 26:25 When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart. 26:26 Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be shewed before the whole congregation. 26:27 Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him. 26:28 A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin. 27:1 Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth. 27:2 Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips. 27:3 A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath is heavier than them both. 27:4 Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy? 27:5 Open rebuke is better than secret love. 27:6 Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful. 27:7 The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet. 27:8 As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that wandereth from his place. 27:9 Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel. 27:10 Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity: for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off. 27:11 My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me. 27:12 A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the simple pass on, and are punished. 27:13 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman. 27:14 He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him. 27:15 A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike. 27:16 Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, which bewrayeth itself. 27:17 Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend. 27:18 Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured. 27:19 As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man. 27:20 Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied. 27:21 As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is a man to his praise. 27:22 Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him. 27:23 Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds. 27:24 For riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to every generation? 27:25 The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered. 27:26 The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of the field. 27:27 And thou shalt have goats' milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and for the maintenance for thy maidens. 28:1 The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion. 28:2 For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged. 28:3 A poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food. 28:4 They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them. 28:5 Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all things. 28:6 Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich. 28:7 Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father. 28:8 He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for
