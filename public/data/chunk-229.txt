45:15 The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat in due season. 145:16 Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing. 145:17 The LORD is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works. 145:18 The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth. 145:19 He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them. 145:20 The LORD preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy. 145:21 My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever. 146:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul. 146:2 While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being. 146:3 Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. 146:4 His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish. 146:5 Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the LORD his God: 146:6 Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keepeth truth for ever: 146:7 Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food to the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners: 146:8 The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind: the LORD raiseth them that are bowed down: the LORD loveth the righteous: 146:9 The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down. 146:10 The LORD shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the LORD. 147:1 Praise ye the LORD: for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely. 147:2 The LORD doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel. 147:3 He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds. 147:4 He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their names. 147:5 Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is infinite. 147:6 The LORD lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to the ground. 147:7 Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God: 147:8 Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains. 147:9 He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry. 147:10 He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man. 147:11 The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy. 147:12 Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion. 147:13 For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee. 147:14 He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat. 147:15 He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth very swiftly. 147:16 He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes. 147:17 He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold? 147:18 He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow. 147:19 He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel. 147:20 He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD. 148:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the LORD from the heavens: praise him in the heights. 148:2 Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts. 148:3 Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light. 148:4 Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above the heavens. 148:5 Let them praise the name of the LORD: for he commanded, and they were created. 148:6 He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a decree which shall not pass. 148:7 Praise the LORD from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps: 148:8 Fire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his word: 148:9 Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars: 148:10 Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl: 148:11 Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth: 148:12 Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children: 148:13 Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven. 148:14 He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye the LORD. 149:1 Praise ye the LORD. Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise in the congregation of saints. 149:2 Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of Zion be joyful in their King. 149:3 Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp. 149:4 For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation. 149:5 Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds. 149:6 Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hand; 149:7 To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the people; 149:8 To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; 149:9 To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints. Praise ye the LORD. 150:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the firmament of his power. 150:2 Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness. 150:3 Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the psaltery and harp. 150:4 Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and organs. 150:5 Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high sounding cymbals. 150:6 Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Praise ye the LORD. The Proverbs 1:1 The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; 1:2 To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding; 1:3 To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity; 1:4 To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion. 1:5 A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels: 1:6 To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings. 1:7 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction. 1:8 My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother: 1:9 For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck. 1:10 My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not. 1:11 If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause: 1:12 Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit: 1:13 We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil: 1:14 Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse: 1:15 My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path: 1:16 For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood. 1:17 Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird. 1:18 And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives. 1:19 So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof. 1:20 Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets: 1:21 She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying, 1:22 How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? 1:23 Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you. 1:24 Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; 1:25 But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof: 1:26 I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; 1:27 When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. 1:28 Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me: 1:29 For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD: 1:30 They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof. 1:31 Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. 1:32 For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. 1:33 But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil. 2:1 My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee; 2:2 So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding; 2:3 Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding; 2:4 If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures; 2:5 Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God. 2:6 For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding. 2:7 He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly. 2:8 He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints. 2:9 Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path. 2:10 When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul; 2:11 Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee: 2:12 To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things; 2:13 Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness; 2:14 Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked; 2:15
