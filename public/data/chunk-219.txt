ce, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God. 83:2 For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. 83:3 They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones. 83:4 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. 83:5 For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee: 83:6 The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes; 83:7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre; 83:8 Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah. 83:9 Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison: 83:10 Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth. 83:11 Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna: 83:12 Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession. 83:13 O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind. 83:14 As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire; 83:15 So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm. 83:16 Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD. 83:17 Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish: 83:18 That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth. 84:1 How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts! 84:2 My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God. 84:3 Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God. 84:4 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah. 84:5 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them. 84:6 Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools. 84:7 They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God. 84:8 O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah. 84:9 Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed. 84:10 For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness. 84:11 For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. 84:12 O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee. 85:1 Lord, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob. 85:2 Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin. Selah. 85:3 Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger. 85:4 Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease. 85:5 Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations? 85:6 Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee? 85:7 Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation. 85:8 I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly. 85:9 Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land. 85:10 Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other. 85:11 Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven. 85:12 Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase. 85:13 Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way of his steps. 86:1 Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy. 86:2 Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee. 86:3 Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily. 86:4 Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. 86:5 For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee. 86:6 Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications. 86:7 In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me. 86:8 Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works. 86:9 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name. 86:10 For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone. 86:11 Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name. 86:12 I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore. 86:13 For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell. 86:14 O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before them. 86:15 But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious, long suffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth. 86:16 O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid. 86:17 Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me. 87:1 His foundation is in the holy mountains. 87:2 The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. 87:3 Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah. 87:4 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there. 87:5 And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and the highest himself shall establish her. 87:6 The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there. Selah. 87:7 As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there: all my springs are in thee. 88:1 O lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee: 88:2 Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry; 88:3 For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the grave. 88:4 I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man that hath no strength: 88:5 Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand. 88:6 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps. 88:7 Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves. Selah. 88:8 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth. 88:9 Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee. 88:10 Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and praise thee? Selah. 88:11 Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy faithfulness in destruction? 88:12 Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness? 88:13 But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee. 88:14 LORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face from me? 88:15 I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I suffer thy terrors I am distracted. 88:16 Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off. 88:17 They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together. 88:18 Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkness. 89:1 I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations. 89:2 For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens. 89:3 I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant, 89:4 Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah. 89:5 And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints. 89:6 For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD? 89:7 God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him. 89:8 O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee? 89:9 Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them. 89:10 Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm. 89:11 The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them. 89:12 The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name. 89:13 Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand. 89:14 Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face. 89:15 Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance. 89:16 In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted. 89:17 For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted. 89:18 For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our king. 89:19 Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people. 89:20 I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him: 89:21 With whom my hand shall be established: m
