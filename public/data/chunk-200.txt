intance are verily estranged from me. 19:14 My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me. 19:15 They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight. 19:16 I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him with my mouth. 19:17 My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children's sake of mine own body. 19:18 Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me. 19:19 All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me. 19:20 My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth. 19:21 Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me. 19:22 Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh? 19:23 Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book! 19:24 That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever! 19:25 For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: 19:26 And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God: 19:27 Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me. 19:28 But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me? 19:29 Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment. 20:1 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 20:2 Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste. 20:3 I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer. 20:4 Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth, 20:5 That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment? 20:6 Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds; 20:7 Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he? 20:8 He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night. 20:9 The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him. 20:10 His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods. 20:11 His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust. 20:12 Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue; 20:13 Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth: 20:14 Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him. 20:15 He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly. 20:16 He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him. 20:17 He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter. 20:18 That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down: according to his substance shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein. 20:19 Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not; 20:20 Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired. 20:21 There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods. 20:22 In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him. 20:23 When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating. 20:24 He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike him through. 20:25 It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him. 20:26 All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle. 20:27 The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him. 20:28 The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath. 20:29 This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God. 21:1 But Job answered and said, 21:2 Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations. 21:3 Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on. 21:4 As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled? 21:5 Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth. 21:6 Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh. 21:7 Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power? 21:8 Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes. 21:9 Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them. 21:10 Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf. 21:11 They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance. 21:12 They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ. 21:13 They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave. 21:14 Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. 21:15 What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him? 21:16 Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me. 21:17 How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger. 21:18 They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away. 21:19 God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it. 21:20 His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty. 21:21 For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst? 21:22 Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high. 21:23 One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet. 21:24 His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow. 21:25 And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure. 21:26 They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them. 21:27 Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me. 21:28 For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked? 21:29 Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens, 21:30 That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath. 21:31 Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done? 21:32 Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb. 21:33 The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him. 21:34 How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood? 22:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 22:2 Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself? 22:3 Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect? 22:4 Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment? 22:5 Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite? 22:6 For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing. 22:7 Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry. 22:8 But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it. 22:9 Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken. 22:10 Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee; 22:11 Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee. 22:12 Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are! 22:13 And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud? 22:14 Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven. 22:15 Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden? 22:16 Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood: 22:17 Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them? 22:18 Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me. 22:19 The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn. 22:20 Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth. 22:21 Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee. 22:22 Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart. 22:23 If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles. 22:24 Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks. 22:25 Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver. 22:26 For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God. 22:27 Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows. 22:28 Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways. 22:29 When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and he shall save the humble person. 22:30 He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the purenes
