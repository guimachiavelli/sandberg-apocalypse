e adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul. 109:21 But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake: because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me. 109:22 For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me. 109:23 I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust. 109:24 My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness. 109:25 I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me they shaked their heads. 109:26 Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy: 109:27 That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast done it. 109:28 Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice. 109:29 Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle. 109:30 I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude. 109:31 For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul. 110:1 The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. 110:2 The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. 110:3 Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth. 110:4 The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek. 110:5 The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath. 110:6 He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries. 110:7 He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head. 111:1 Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation. 111:2 The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein. 111:3 His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever. 111:4 He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is gracious and full of compassion. 111:5 He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant. 111:6 He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen. 111:7 The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure. 111:8 They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness. 111:9 He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name. 111:10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for ever. 112:1 Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD, that delighteth greatly in his commandments. 112:2 His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed. 112:3 Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth for ever. 112:4 Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous. 112:5 A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with discretion. 112:6 Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance. 112:7 He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD. 112:8 His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his desire upon his enemies. 112:9 He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour. 112:10 The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish. 113:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD. 113:2 Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. 113:3 From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the LORD's name is to be praised. 113:4 The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens. 113:5 Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high, 113:6 Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth! 113:7 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill; 113:8 That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people. 113:9 He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the LORD. 114:1 When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language; 114:2 Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion. 114:3 The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back. 114:4 The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs. 114:5 What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back? 114:6 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs? 114:7 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob; 114:8 Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters. 115:1 Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake. 115:2 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God? 115:3 But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased. 115:4 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands. 115:5 They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not: 115:6 They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not: 115:7 They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat. 115:8 They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them. 115:9 O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their shield. 115:10 O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield. 115:11 Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield. 115:12 The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron. 115:13 He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great. 115:14 The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your children. 115:15 Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth. 115:16 The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD's: but the earth hath he given to the children of men. 115:17 The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence. 115:18 But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the LORD. 116:1 I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications. 116:2 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live. 116:3 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow. 116:4 Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul. 116:5 Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful. 116:6 The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me. 116:7 Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee. 116:8 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling. 116:9 I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living. 116:10 I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted: 116:11 I said in my haste, All men are liars. 116:12 What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward me? 116:13 I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD. 116:14 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people. 116:15 Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints. 116:16 O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds. 116:17 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD. 116:18 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people. 116:19 In the courts of the LORD's house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD. 117:1 O praise the LORD, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people. 117:2 For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of the LORD endureth for ever. Praise ye the LORD. 118:1 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: because his mercy endureth for ever. 118:2 Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever. 118:3 Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for ever. 118:4 Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy endureth for ever. 118:5 I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, and set me in a large place. 118:6 The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me? 118:7 The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me. 118:8 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man. 118:9 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes. 118:10 All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them. 118:11 They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them. 118:12 They compassed me about like bees: they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them. 118:13 Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped me. 118:14 The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation. 118:15 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly. 118:16 The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly. 118:17 I
