3:9 He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever. 103:10 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. 103:11 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him. 103:12 As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us. 103:13 Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him. 103:14 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust. 103:15 As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. 103:16 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more. 103:17 But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children; 103:18 To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them. 103:19 The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all. 103:20 Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word. 103:21 Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure. 103:22 Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul. 104:1 Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty. 104:2 Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain: 104:3 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind: 104:4 Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire: 104:5 Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever. 104:6 Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains. 104:7 At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away. 104:8 They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them. 104:9 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth. 104:10 He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills. 104:11 They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst. 104:12 By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which sing among the branches. 104:13 He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works. 104:14 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth; 104:15 And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart. 104:16 The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted; 104:17 Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house. 104:18 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for the conies. 104:19 He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down. 104:20 Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth. 104:21 The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God. 104:22 The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens. 104:23 Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening. 104:24 O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches. 104:25 So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts. 104:26 There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein. 104:27 These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season. 104:28 That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good. 104:29 Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust. 104:30 Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth. 104:31 The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works. 104:32 He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke. 104:33 I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being. 104:34 My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD. 104:35 Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD. 105:1 O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people. 105:2 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works. 105:3 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD. 105:4 Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore. 105:5 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; 105:6 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen. 105:7 He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth. 105:8 He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations. 105:9 Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac; 105:10 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant: 105:11 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance: 105:12 When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it. 105:13 When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people; 105:14 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes; 105:15 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm. 105:16 Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread. 105:17 He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant: 105:18 Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron: 105:19 Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him. 105:20 The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free. 105:21 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance: 105:22 To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom. 105:23 Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. 105:24 And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies. 105:25 He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants. 105:26 He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen. 105:27 They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham. 105:28 He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word. 105:29 He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish. 105:30 Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings. 105:31 He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all their coasts. 105:32 He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land. 105:33 He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts. 105:34 He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number, 105:35 And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground. 105:36 He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength. 105:37 He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes. 105:38 Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them. 105:39 He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night. 105:40 The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven. 105:41 He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river. 105:42 For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant. 105:43 And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness: 105:44 And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people; 105:45 That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD. 106:1 Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. 106:2 Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth all his praise? 106:3 Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times. 106:4 Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy salvation; 106:5 That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance. 106:6 We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly. 106:7 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea. 106:8 Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known. 106:9 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness. 106:10 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. 106:11 And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left. 106:12 Then believed they his words; they sang his praise. 106:13 They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel: 106:14 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert. 106:15 And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul. 106:16 They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD. 106:17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the company of Abiram. 106:18 And a fire
