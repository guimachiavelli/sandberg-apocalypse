at ye should inherit a blessing.    3:10 For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain  his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile: 3:11 Let  him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.    3:12 For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are  open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that  do evil.    3:13 And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that  which is good?  3:14 But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake,  happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;  3:15 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to  give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that  is in you with meekness and fear: 3:16 Having a good conscience; that,  whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed  that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.    3:17 For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for  well doing, than for evil doing.    3:18 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the  unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the  flesh, but quickened by the Spirit: 3:19 By which also he went and  preached unto the spirits in prison; 3:20 Which sometime were  disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of  Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls  were saved by water.    3:21 The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not  the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good  conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ: 3:22 Who  is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and  authorities and powers being made subject unto him.    4:1 Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm  yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in  the flesh hath ceased from sin; 4:2 That he no longer should live the  rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of  God.    4:3 For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the  will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess  of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries: 4:4  Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same  excess of riot, speaking evil of you: 4:5 Who shall give account to  him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.    4:6 For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are  dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but  live according to God in the spirit.    4:7 But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and  watch unto prayer.    4:8 And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for  charity shall cover the multitude of sins.    4:9 Use hospitality one to another without grudging.    4:10 As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same  one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.    4:11 If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man  minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God  in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise  and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.    4:12 Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is  to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: 4:13 But  rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that,  when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding  joy.    4:14 If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the  spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil  spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.    4:15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an  evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.    4:16 Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but  let him glorify God on this behalf.    4:17 For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of  God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that  obey not the gospel of God?  4:18 And if the righteous scarcely be  saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?  4:19 Wherefore  let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping  of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.    5:1 The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and  a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the  glory that shall be revealed: 5:2 Feed the flock of God which is among  you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly;  not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; 5:3 Neither as being lords  over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.    5:4 And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown  of glory that fadeth not away.    5:5 Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all  of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for  God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.    5:6 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he  may exalt you in due time: 5:7 Casting all your care upon him; for he  careth for you.    5:8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a  roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: 5:9 Whom  resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are  accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.    5:10 But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal  glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you  perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.    5:11 To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.    5:12 By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have  written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace  of God wherein ye stand.    5:13 The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you,  saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son.    5:14 Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you  all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.          The Second General Epistle of Peter      1:1 Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them  that have obtained like precious faith with us through the  righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ: 1:2 Grace and peace  be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our  Lord, 1:3 According as his divine power hath given unto us all things  that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him  that hath called us to glory and virtue: 1:4 Whereby are given unto us  exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be  partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is  in the world through lust.    1:5 And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue;  and to virtue knowledge; 1:6 And to knowledge temperance; and to  temperance patience; and to patience godliness; 1:7 And to godliness  brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.    1:8 For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye  shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord  Jesus Christ.    1:9 But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar  off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.    1:10 Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your  calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never  fall: 1:11 For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly  into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.    1:12 Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in  remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established  in the present truth.    1:13 Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir  you up by putting you in remembrance; 1:14 Knowing that shortly I must  put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed  me.    1:15 Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to  have these things always in remembrance.    1:16 For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made  known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were  eyewitnesses of his majesty.    1:17 For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there  came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved  Son, in whom I am well pleased.    1:18 And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with  him in the holy mount.    1:19 We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well  that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until  the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts: 1:20 Knowing this  first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private  interpretation.    1:21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but  holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.    2:1 But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there  shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable  heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon  themselves swift destruction.    2:2 And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the  way of truth shall be evil spoken of.    2:3 And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make  merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not,  and their damnation slumbereth not.    2:4 For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down  to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved  unto judgment; 2:5 And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the  eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon  the world of the ungodly; 2:6 And turning the cities of Sodom a
