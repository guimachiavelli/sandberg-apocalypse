 the folly of fools is deceit. 14:9 Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous there is favour. 14:10 The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy. 14:11 The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish. 14:12 There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death. 14:13 Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth is heaviness. 14:14 The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and a good man shall be satisfied from himself. 14:15 The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh well to his going. 14:16 A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool rageth, and is confident. 14:17 He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked devices is hated. 14:18 The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge. 14:19 The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of the righteous. 14:20 The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich hath many friends. 14:21 He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath mercy on the poor, happy is he. 14:22 Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good. 14:23 In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury. 14:24 The crown of the wise is their riches: but the foolishness of fools is folly. 14:25 A true witness delivereth souls: but a deceitful witness speaketh lies. 14:26 In the fear of the LORD is strong confidence: and his children shall have a place of refuge. 14:27 The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death. 14:28 In the multitude of people is the king's honour: but in the want of people is the destruction of the prince. 14:29 He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly. 14:30 A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness of the bones. 14:31 He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor. 14:32 The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous hath hope in his death. 14:33 Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: but that which is in the midst of fools is made known. 14:34 Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people. 14:35 The king's favour is toward a wise servant: but his wrath is against him that causeth shame. 15:1 A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger. 15:2 The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness. 15:3 The eyes of the LORD are in every place, beholding the evil and the good. 15:4 A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit. 15:5 A fool despiseth his father's instruction: but he that regardeth reproof is prudent. 15:6 In the house of the righteous is much treasure: but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble. 15:7 The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the foolish doeth not so. 15:8 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright is his delight. 15:9 The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD: but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness. 15:10 Correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way: and he that hateth reproof shall die. 15:11 Hell and destruction are before the LORD: how much more then the hearts of the children of men? 15:12 A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him: neither will he go unto the wise. 15:13 A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken. 15:14 The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge: but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness. 15:15 All the days of the afflicted are evil: but he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast. 15:16 Better is little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure and trouble therewith. 15:17 Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith. 15:18 A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife. 15:19 The way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns: but the way of the righteous is made plain. 15:20 A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth his mother. 15:21 Folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom: but a man of understanding walketh uprightly. 15:22 Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the multitude of counsellors they are established. 15:23 A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word spoken in due season, how good is it! 15:24 The way of life is above to the wise, that he may depart from hell beneath. 15:25 The LORD will destroy the house of the proud: but he will establish the border of the widow. 15:26 The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the LORD: but the words of the pure are pleasant words. 15:27 He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that hateth gifts shall live. 15:28 The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things. 15:29 The LORD is far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of the righteous. 15:30 The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: and a good report maketh the bones fat. 15:31 The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise. 15:32 He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding. 15:33 The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom; and before honour is humility. 16:1 The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, is from the LORD. 16:2 All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the LORD weigheth the spirits. 16:3 Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established. 16:4 The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil. 16:5 Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished. 16:6 By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil. 16:7 When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him. 16:8 Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right. 16:9 A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps. 16:10 A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment. 16:11 A just weight and balance are the LORD's: all the weights of the bag are his work. 16:12 It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne is established by righteousness. 16:13 Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right. 16:14 The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it. 16:15 In the light of the king's countenance is life; and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain. 16:16 How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver! 16:17 The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul. 16:18 Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall. 16:19 Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud. 16:20 He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy is he. 16:21 The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning. 16:22 Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools is folly. 16:23 The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips. 16:24 Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones. 16:25 There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death. 16:26 He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him. 16:27 An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips there is as a burning fire. 16:28 A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends. 16:29 A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good. 16:30 He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass. 16:31 The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness. 16:32 He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city. 16:33 The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD. 17:1 Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices with strife. 17:2 A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren. 17:3 The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD trieth the hearts. 17:4 A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue. 17:5 Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished. 17:6 Children's children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers. 17:7 Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince. 17:8 A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth. 17:9 He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends. 17:10 A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool. 17:11 An evil man seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him. 17:12 Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly. 17:13 Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house. 17:14 The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out
