d thy right hand shall save me. 138:8 The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O LORD, endureth for ever: forsake not the works of thine own hands. 139:1 O lord, thou hast searched me, and known me. 139:2 Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. 139:3 Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways. 139:4 For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether. 139:5 Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me. 139:6 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it. 139:7 Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence? 139:8 If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there. 139:9 If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; 139:10 Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me. 139:11 If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me. 139:12 Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee. 139:13 For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb. 139:14 I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well. 139:15 My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. 139:16 Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them. 139:17 How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them! 139:18 If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee. 139:19 Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men. 139:20 For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain. 139:21 Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee? 139:22 I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies. 139:23 Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: 139:24 And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting. 140:1 Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the violent man; 140:2 Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are they gathered together for war. 140:3 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders' poison is under their lips. Selah. 140:4 Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings. 140:5 The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah. 140:6 I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my supplications, O LORD. 140:7 O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle. 140:8 Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his wicked device; lest they exalt themselves. Selah. 140:9 As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them. 140:10 Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again. 140:11 Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him. 140:12 I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and the right of the poor. 140:13 Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence. 141:1 Lord, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee. 141:2 Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice. 141:3 Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips. 141:4 Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties. 141:5 Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities. 141:6 When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet. 141:7 Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth. 141:8 But mine eyes are unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute. 141:9 Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity. 141:10 Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape. 142:1 I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD did I make my supplication. 142:2 I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble. 142:3 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me. 142:4 I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul. 142:5 I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living. 142:6 Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I. 142:7 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me. 143:1 Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness. 143:2 And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified. 143:3 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead. 143:4 Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate. 143:5 I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands. 143:6 I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land. Selah. 143:7 Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit. 143:8 Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee. 143:9 Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me. 143:10 Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is good; lead me into the land of uprightness. 143:11 Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake: for thy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble. 143:12 And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant. 144:1 Blessed be the LORD my strength which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight: 144:2 My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me. 144:3 LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the son of man, that thou makest account of him! 144:4 Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth away. 144:5 Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke. 144:6 Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them. 144:7 Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children; 144:8 Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood. 144:9 I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee. 144:10 It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword. 144:11 Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood: 144:12 That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace: 144:13 That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store: that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets: 144:14 That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our streets. 144:15 Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is that people, whose God is the LORD. 145:1 I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever. 145:2 Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever. 145:3 Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness is unsearchable. 145:4 One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts. 145:5 I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works. 145:6 And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I will declare thy greatness. 145:7 They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness. 145:8 The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy. 145:9 The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works. 145:10 All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD; and thy saints shall bless thee. 145:11 They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power; 145:12 To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom. 145:13 Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations. 145:14 The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that be bowed down. 1
