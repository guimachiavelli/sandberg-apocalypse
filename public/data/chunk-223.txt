was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked. 106:19 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image. 106:20 Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass. 106:21 They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt; 106:22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea. 106:23 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them. 106:24 Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word: 106:25 But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD. 106:26 Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness: 106:27 To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands. 106:28 They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead. 106:29 Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them. 106:30 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed. 106:31 And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore. 106:32 They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes: 106:33 Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips. 106:34 They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them: 106:35 But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works. 106:36 And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them. 106:37 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils, 106:38 And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood. 106:39 Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions. 106:40 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance. 106:41 And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them. 106:42 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand. 106:43 Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity. 106:44 Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry: 106:45 And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies. 106:46 He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives. 106:47 Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise. 106:48 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD. 107:1 O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. 107:2 Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy; 107:3 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south. 107:4 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in. 107:5 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them. 107:6 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses. 107:7 And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation. 107:8 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! 107:9 For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness. 107:10 Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron; 107:11 Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High: 107:12 Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help. 107:13 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses. 107:14 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder. 107:15 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! 107:16 For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder. 107:17 Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted. 107:18 Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death. 107:19 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses. 107:20 He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions. 107:21 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! 107:22 And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing. 107:23 They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; 107:24 These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep. 107:25 For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof. 107:26 They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble. 107:27 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit's end. 107:28 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. 107:29 He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still. 107:30 Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven. 107:31 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! 107:32 Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders. 107:33 He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground; 107:34 A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein. 107:35 He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings. 107:36 And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation; 107:37 And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase. 107:38 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease. 107:39 Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow. 107:40 He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way. 107:41 Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock. 107:42 The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth. 107:43 Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD. 108:1 O god, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory. 108:2 Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early. 108:3 I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations. 108:4 For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds. 108:5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth; 108:6 That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and answer me. 108:7 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. 108:8 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver; 108:9 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph. 108:10 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom? 108:11 Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts? 108:12 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man. 108:13 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies. 109:1 Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise; 109:2 For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue. 109:3 They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause. 109:4 For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto prayer. 109:5 And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love. 109:6 Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand. 109:7 When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin. 109:8 Let his days be few; and let another take his office. 109:9 Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow. 109:10 Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places. 109:11 Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour. 109:12 Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children. 109:13 Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out. 109:14 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out. 109:15 Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth. 109:16 Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart. 109:17 As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him. 109:18 As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones. 109:19 Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually. 109:20 Let this be the reward of min
