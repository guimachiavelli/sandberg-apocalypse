nd  Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an  ensample unto those that after should live ungodly; 2:7 And delivered  just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked: 2:8 (For  that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed  his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;) 2:9 The  Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to  reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished: 2:10 But  chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and  despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not  afraid to speak evil of dignities.    2:11 Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not  railing accusation against them before the Lord.    2:12 But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and  destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and  shall utterly perish in their own corruption; 2:13 And shall receive  the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot  in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves  with their own deceivings while they feast with you; 2:14 Having eyes  full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable  souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed  children: 2:15 Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray,  following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of  unrighteousness; 2:16 But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass  speaking with man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet.    2:17 These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a  tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.    2:18 For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure  through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that  were clean escaped from them who live in error.    2:19 While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants  of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he  brought in bondage.    2:20 For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world  through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are  again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with  them than the beginning.    2:21 For it had been better for them not to have known the way of  righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy  commandment delivered unto them.    2:22 But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The  dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to  her wallowing in the mire.    3:1 This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which  I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance: 3:2 That ye may be  mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets,  and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour: 3:3  Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers,  walking after their own lusts, 3:4 And saying, Where is the promise of  his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as  they were from the beginning of the creation.    3:5 For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God  the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and  in the water: 3:6 Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed  with water, perished: 3:7 But the heavens and the earth, which are  now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against  the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.    3:8 But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is  with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.    3:9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count  slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any  should perish, but that all should come to repentance.    3:10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the  which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements  shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are  therein shall be burned up.    3:11 Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner  of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, 3:12  Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the  heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt  with fervent heat?  3:13 Nevertheless we, according to his promise,  look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.    3:14 Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be  diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and  blameless.    3:15 And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even  as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto  him hath written unto you; 3:16 As also in all his epistles, speaking  in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be  understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they  do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.    3:17 Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware  lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from  your own stedfastness.    3:18 But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour  Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.          The First Epistle General of John      1:1 That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we  have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have  handled, of the Word of life; 1:2 (For the life was manifested, and we  have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life,  which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;) 1:3 That which  we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have  fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and  with his Son Jesus Christ.    1:4 And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.    1:5 This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare  unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.    1:6 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness,  we lie, and do not the truth: 1:7 But if we walk in the light, as he  is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of  Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.    1:8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth  is not in us.    1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our  sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.    1:10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his  word is not in us.    2:1 My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin  not.    And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ  the righteous: 2:2 And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not  for our's only, but also for the sins of the whole world.    2:3 And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his  commandments.    2:4 He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a  liar, and the truth is not in him.    2:5 But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God  perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.    2:6 He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk,  even as he walked.    2:7 Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old  commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is  the word which ye have heard from the beginning.    2:8 Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in  him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now  shineth.    2:9 He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in  darkness even until now.    2:10 He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is  none occasion of stumbling in him.    2:11 But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in  darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath  blinded his eyes.    2:12 I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven  you for his name's sake.    2:13 I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from  the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome  the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have  known the Father.    2:14 I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that  is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye  are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome  the wicked one.    2:15 Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If  any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.    2:16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust  of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of  the world.    2:17 And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that  doeth the will of God abideth for ever.    2:18 Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that  antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we  know that it is the last time.    2:19 They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had  been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went  out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.    2:20 But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.    2:21 I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but  because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.    2:22 Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is  antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.    2:23 Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that  acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.    2:24 Let that theref
